<p>One would be hard-pressed to think of any other event or phenomenon
more universally experienced by Filipinos than a cyclone or what we
Filipinos call <strong><em>bagyo</em></strong> (pronounced /baɡˈjo/,
[bɐɡˈjo]). My earliest memory related to cyclones was when I was 4 years
old and my older brother and I were put into an empty plastic drum to
float above flood waters pushed along by our mother. My mother recounts
how happy and excited my brother and I was being inside that drum,
oblivious to the strong gusts of wind and heavy rains outside. She did
her best to steady the drum and shield us from the wind and rain while
she waded through chest-deep flood waters to get to a place of refuge.
As I grew up, cyclones would provide interesting chapters into my
formative years. I still recall the joy of having school cancelled when
the incoming cyclone was determined to be too strong and potentially
unsafe followed by an immediate realisation that I would just end up
being stuck at home and unable to play because of the harsh conditions
outside and the constant possibility of flooding. In my second year of
medical school, I volunteered to live in a small remote fishing village
in the main northern island of the Philippines. The village lies along
the usual path of cyclones that develop on the Philippine Sea to the
east. As to be expected, midway into my time there was when I
experienced the raw power of cyclones. Over a three-day period, two
typhoon category cyclones made landfall near the area of the fishing
village and with the eye of the storm, the spot with the lowest pressure
and fastest sustained wind speed, passing very close by. This was very
transformative and made the experiences of those in the margins -
whether physical, social, or economical - tangible and real for me.</p>
<p>Now, having lived almost half of my lifetime outside of the
Philippines, I have gone places where I’ve experienced other
life-changing and values-defining events and phenomenon. These, along
with my cyclones experience, continue to shape and inform my notion and
understanding of fairness, diversity, and equity.</p>
<p>It is from this background that this R package was borne out of. Just
like a songwriter’s lyrics and melody for a loved one or a poet’s ode to
their muse, this package is a nod to my youth and a loving embrace to my
motherland. I’ve always thought of how good it would be to have a
dataset that I, and others like me, will be able to relate to. I hope
this dataset can be an adjunct to the well-established <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/iris.html" class="external-link"><code>iris</code></a>
dataset and to the currently popular <a href="https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/" class="external-link"><code>palmerpenguins</code></a>
dataset.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="about-the-bagyo-data">About the <code>bagyo</code> data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#about-the-bagyo-data"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>bagyo</code> package contains the <code>bagyo</code>
dataset. This dataset was taken from annual reports on Philippine
tropical cyclones prepared and released by <a href="https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/" class="external-link">PAGASA</a> at its <a href="https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tropical-cyclone/publications/annual-report" class="external-link">website</a>
in PDF format.</p>
<p>Because the reports are in PDF format and the information described
above are in tables within the documents, scripts for scraping the
desired data were developed and implemented to arrive at the
<code>bagyo</code> dataset. The data scraping script can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/panukatan/bagyo/blob/main/data-raw/process_data.R" class="external-link">here</a>.</p>
<p>The following information is available from the dataset:</p>
<table class="table">

<p>This metadata can be viewed in R through a call to
<code><a href="../reference/bagyo.html">?bagyo</a></code> in the R console.</p>
<p>Whilst tropical cyclones have affected the Philippines far earlier
than 2017 and more currently than 2022, official and publicly available
data for the information described above is only available in the
reports for years 2017 to 2020. Earlier documents of this annual
reporting pre-2017 have been produced but are not available on the <a href="https://www.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/" class="external-link">PAGASA</a> website. These reports
of the tropical cyclone season (re-started in 2019) are published within
two years after the termination of the season. Hence, the most recent
report is only up to 2022 for now.</p>
<p>It is expected that reports for 2023 onwards will continue to be
published and made available by PAGASA. As such, the <code>bagyo</code>
package and the <code>bagyo</code> dataset within it will be updated
accordingly. Continued efforts are also being taken to find sources of
information for years preceding 2017.</p>
