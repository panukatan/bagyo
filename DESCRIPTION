Description: The Philippines frequently experiences tropical cyclones (called
    'bagyo' in the Filipino language) because of its geographical position.
    These cyclones typically bring heavy rainfall, leading to widespread
    flooding, as well as strong winds that cause significant damage to human
    life, crops, and property. Data on cyclones are collected and curated by the
    Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services
    Administration or 'PAGASA' and made available through its website
    <https://bagong.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/tropical-cyclone/publications/annual-report>.
    This package contains Philippine tropical cyclones data in a
    machine-readable format. It is hoped that this data package provides an
    interesting and unique dataset for data exploration and visualisation.
