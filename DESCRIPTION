Description: The Philippines frequently experiences tropical cyclones (called
    'bagyo' in the Filipino language) because of its geographical position. 
    These cyclones typically bring heavy rainfall, leading to widespread 
    flooding, as well as strong winds that cause significant damage to human 
    life, crops, and property. Data on cyclones are collected and curated by the 
    Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services 
    Administration or 'PAGASA' and made available through its website. This 
    package contains Philippine tropical cyclones data in a machine-readable 
    format. It is hoped that this data package provides an interesting and 
    unique dataset for data exploration and visualisation.
