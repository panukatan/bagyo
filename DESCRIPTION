Description: The Philippines frequently experiences tropical cyclones (called
    bagyo in the Filipino language) because of its geographical position. These 
    cyclones typically bring heavy rainfall, leading to widespread flooding, as 
    well as strong winds that cause significant damage to human life, crops, 
    and property. Data on cyclones are collected and curated by the Philippine
    Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA)
    and made available through its website. This package contains Philippine
    Tropical Cyclone data in a machine-readable format. It is hoped that this
    data package provides an interesting and unique dataset for data exploration 
    and visualisation.
